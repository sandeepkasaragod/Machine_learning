This repo will provide the step-by-step procedure to tune the deep learning models using "Breast cancer data". The data has been downloaded from "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data" 
1.  breast_cancer-1:- Contains basic deep learning codes (Especially for a beginner to understand)
2.  breast_cancer-2:- Added the train_test_split methods
3.  breast_cancer-3:- Easy data handling with pandas
4.  breast_cancer-4:- Generate model summary, save the model and load the model for prediction 
5.  breast_cancer-5:- Added n-fold method, this will shuffle the train and test sets to provide a better prediction outcome
